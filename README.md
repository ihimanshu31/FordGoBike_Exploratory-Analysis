Project:5 -Communicate Data Findings (Ford GoBike )

  This project is divided into two major parts.

  In the first part, you will conduct an exploratory data analysis on a dataset of your choosing.
  In the second part, you will take your main findings from your exploration and convey them to others through an explanatory analysis.

  I will perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by Ford GoBike, a bike-share system provider.
